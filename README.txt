Year 1 Android project

A simple Android to do list app per a school assignment, written in Java.

Our app needed to have a login and register for new users. Each user should be able to see their own tasks. Tasks can be marked done and can be assigned labels for grouping/filtering. Tasks can be edited and deleted.
Similarly labels can also be created, edited, and deleted.

Most of the programming was done within a week by me and one other teammate. It was our very first app, with two earlier assignments focused on just Java.
This github repository is not the original one, that one is private and managed by the university.
